Market store assignment, for Java Spring 2021

For this assignment, I made a parent class named Card which contains all variables and a method named Total. 
Classes Bronze, Silver, and Gold extend the Card class, and override the method Total. 
In the main class MarketStore I created an instance of every class to test the method Total.
